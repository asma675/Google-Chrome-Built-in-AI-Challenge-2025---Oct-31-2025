# 🧠 Word Explainer – Chrome Extension  
Created for the Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025  

---

## 🚀 Overview
**Word Explainer** is a Chrome Extension that helps users better understand or rephrase text directly within the browser.  
Using Chrome’s new built-in AI powered by **Gemini Nano**, it can explain or rewrite selected text in plain English while keeping everything local on your device. This provides both privacy and instant results without relying on an internet connection.

## 🧩 The Problem
When reading online content, people often encounter words or sentences that are confusing or too complex.  
Switching between tabs to search for meanings or simpler phrasing disrupts focus and slows down reading. Readers need a faster and smoother way to make sense of difficult passages without leaving the page.

---

## 💡 The Solution
**Word Explainer** allows you to highlight any word or paragraph on a web page and instantly receive a clear explanation or an alternative version of the text.  
It runs entirely within Chrome, using local AI processing to provide quick and private results. This makes it useful for anyone who reads, writes, or studies online.
