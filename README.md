## 🧩 The Problem
People frequently come across unclear or overly complicated words or sentences when reading online content.  
Reading is slowed down and distracted when one flips between tabs to look for definitions or simpler phrases. There must be a quicker and easier way for readers to understand challenging parts without ever leaving the page.
